# PartyHard
Party Hard(cool name huh?) is a school project for my final exam.
The project is meant to show what a framework is... and obviously have fun!
This project uses LibGDX a useful Java framework for 2d or 3d projects.

The project is now stopped after 4 months or so of developping.

If you have any question please contact me
