# PartyHard
Party Hard(cool name huh?) is a game school project for my final exam.
The project is meant to show what a framework is... and obviously have fun!
This project uses LibGDX a useful Java framework for 2d or 3d projects.

The project is now stopped after 4 months or so of development.

The game is a classic rpg, it has: levelling, spells, classes, monsters, bosses, maps, shops, inventory.

Software used: 
- TiledMap, for... maps :)
- LibGDX as the main framework
- freesound.org for sound related stuff
- Eclipse as my good old friend, and ide ;)

# Thoughts

Even if the project was super cool to made, I had the best nights of my life, it didn't got recognized as the jury was composed of old teachers. But, it was cool.

If I ever have to a similar project again, i would certainly pick another language and another framework, maybe C++ and SFML, because Java is cool and all but, not really good performance-wise.


If you have any question, please fell free to contact me :)
